        <p>
            Mom, you're a wonderful mother,<br/>
               So gentle, yet so strong.<br/>
            The many ways you show you care<br/>
            Always make me feel I belong.<br/>
            <br/>
            You're patient when I'm foolish;<br/>
            You give guidance when I ask;<br/>
            It seems you can do most anything;<br/>
            You're the master of every task.<br/>
            <br/>
            You're a dependable source of comfort;<br/>
            You're my cushion when I fall.<br/>
            You help in times of trouble;<br/>
            You support me whenever I call.<br/>
            <br/>
            I love you more than you know;<br/>
            You have my total respect.<br/>
            If I had my choice of mothers,<br/>
            You'd be the one I'd select!<br/>
            <br/>
