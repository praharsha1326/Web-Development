                Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it’s the summer
                
                grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking 
                
                on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries 
                
                special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can 
                
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
                
                are from, where they traveled and what happened to them 
                
                along the  way. But doing these analyses has been complex 
                
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new 
                
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

                    Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement---but 
                    
                    life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. 
                    
                    The June 26-28 Stanford’s Dance weekend in Roble Gym 
                    
                    offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: 
                    
                    the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood 
                    
                    and blues fusion.
